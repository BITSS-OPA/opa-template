Open in RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BITSS-OPA/opa-template/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Go straight to the Shiny app: [here](https://aleksandrama.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_template/)

*Note:* to edit this readme file, please edit the `readme.Rmd` file and knit using RStudio. 

This repository and its accompanying dynamic document and Shiny app are three key components of an Open Policy Analysis (OPA) on <INSERT TOPIC>. Together, these materials create a transparent and reproducible analysis to facilitate collaboration and discussion about <INSERT TOPIC>.

1 - [An interactive plot](https://aleksandrama.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_template/), which summarizes the interactions between all key parameters for a given set of assumptions. Materials can be found in: [`code/shiny_app`](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-template/tree/main/code/shiny_app).

2 - Open policy report in the form of a [dynamic document](https://bitss-opa.github.io/opa-template/), which details all data, code, and assumptions included in the analysis. Materials can be found in: [`code/dynamic_doc`](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-template/tree/master/code/00_template.Rmd).

3 - This Github repository, which stores all data, code, and materials necessary to replicate the analysis in full with minimal effort.  

This project complies with the highest levels of the [Open Policy Analysis (OPA) Guidelines](https://www.bitss.org/opa/community-standards/). We also look to demonstrate tools, ideas, and practices through which OPA can be implemented in practice. This exercise, and future case studies, in turn will inform the Guidelines.

Major contributions to this project will be acknowledged below. This OPA employs the Contributor Roles Taxonomy ([CRediT](https://casrai.org/credit/)). Major contributions are defined as any pushed revisions to language or source code beyond corrections of spelling and grammar.
