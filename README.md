Open in RStudio:
[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BITSS-OPA/opa-template/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Go straight to the Shiny app:

This repository and its accompanying dynamic document and Shiny app are
three key components of an Open Policy Analysis (OPA) on <INSERT TOPIC>.
Together, these materials create a transparent and reproducible analysis
to facilitate collaboration and discussion about <INSERT TOPIC>.

1 - [An interactive plot](https://fhoces.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_test/),
which summarizes the interactions between all key parameters for a given
set of assumptions. Materials can be found in:
[`code/shiny_app`](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-template/tree/main/code/shiny_app).

2 - Open policy report in the form of a [dynamic
document](https://bitss-opa.github.io/opa-template/), which details all
data, code, and assumptions included in the analysis. Materials can be
found in:
[`code/dynamic_doc`](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-template/tree/master/code/00_template.Rmd).

3 - This Github repository, which stores all data, code, and materials
necessary to replicate the analysis in full with minimal effort.

This project complies with the highest levels of the [Open Policy
Analysis (OPA)
Guidelines](https://www.bitss.org/opa/community-standards/). We also
look to demonstrate tools, ideas, and practices through which OPA can be
implemented in practice. This exercise, and future case studies, in turn
will inform the Guidelines.

BITSS to develop a demonstration of a OPA in your organization please
email Aleks Bogdanoski (<abogdanoski@berkeley.edu>).
